<h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
<h2>Academic Achievements Before College</h2>

<p>Hello, my name is Mary Wood and I am a student at Appalachian State University majoring in Public Health with a focus in Chronic and Infectious Diseases. I am from Salisbury, NC where I graduated from West Rowan High school with honors. Through High school I participated in several clubs and activities including Relay for Life, HOSA, FFA, Student Council, and I was also a member of the yearbook staff. Within these clubs I held officer positions or won at the state and national level with my clubs. My sophomore year of high school I placed first in the FFA Agricultural Mechanics research project which led me to compete at nationals that fall to place 5th in the nation at the FFA Convention in Kentucky. Along with FFA I was very involved in Student Council where I was on executive council every year after my freshman year.</p>
<br>
<p>During high school I was an active member of St.Johns Lutheran Church in Salisbury, NC where I live and attended their traditional service.</p>
